 Spanning Tree Protocol (STP) convergence is the process through which a switched network
achieves a loop-free topology after a change occurs in the network, such as a link failure or recovery.
The primary goal of STP is to prevent network loops caused by redundant links,
ensuring that there is only one active path between any two network devices.

When a network change occurs, STP goes through a series of steps to achieve
convergence and stabilize the network. Here's a brief explanation of the STP convergence process:

Topology Change Detection:
When a network change occurs, such as a link failure or a new link becoming available,
the STP algorithm detects the change. It does this by sending
and receiving Bridge Protocol Data Units (BPDU) between switches.

Topology Change Notification:
Once a topology change is detected, the switch that detected the change sends out
a Topology Change Notification (TCN) BPDU to inform other switches about the change.
This indicates that the network topology may have changed.

Propagating the Topology Change:
The TCN BPDU is flooded throughout the network. All switches
receive this notification, which triggers the STP convergence process.

Listening and Learning States:
Upon receiving the TCN BPDU, switches immediately enter the "Listening" state
for a short period, during which they still receive BPDUs but do not forward data frames.
Then, they enter the "Learning" state, during which they populate their MAC address tables with MAC addresses learned on incoming ports.

Blocking State:
After the "Learning" state, switches enter the "Blocking" state.
In this state, the switches do not forward frames but continue to receive
and process BPDUs from other switches. The "Blocking" state helps avoid
network loops by temporarily blocking redundant paths.

Forwarding State:
Finally, switches transition to the "Forwarding" state for all non-blocked ports
In this state, switches forward frames between devices and establish the loop-free topology.

Loop-Free Topology:
Once all switches have transitioned to the "Forwarding" state
, the network has achieved convergence, and a loop-free topology is established
Only one active path exists between any two network devices.

STP convergence is essential to maintaining network stability and preventing
broadcast storms and other network anomalies caused by loops.
The time taken for STP convergence depends on factors such as the STP version used network size
and the number of switches involved in the topology change.
In modern STP variants like Rapid Spanning Tree Protocol (RSTP) or Multiple Spanning Tree Protocol (MSTP)
convergence times are typically faster than with the original STP.
