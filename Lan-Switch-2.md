```python
802.1X System Authentication Control:
dot1x system-auth-control
: This command enables 802.1X system authentication control
, which enforces authentication on all 802.1X-capable interfaces.

Authentication MAC-Move Permit:
authentication mac-move permit
: This command allows the client's MAC address
to move between ports without triggering a reauthentication event.

Access Ports Configuration:
The following configuration is applied to GigabitEthernet interface 1/0:

switchport
: Enables Layer 2 switching on the interface.

switchport mode access
: Sets the interface to access mode, where only one VLAN is allowed.

switchport access vlan 101
: Specifies VLAN 101 as the data VLAN for the interface.

switchport voice vlan 201
: Specifies VLAN 201 as the voice VLAN for the interface.

no cdp enable
: Disables the Cisco Discovery Protocol (CDP) on the interface.

spanning-tree portfast
: Enables PortFast on the interface,
which reduces the spanning-tree convergence time for access ports.

spanning-tree bpduguard enable
: Enables BPDU Guard on the interface to protect
against rogue switches or misconfigurations.

Storm-Control Configuration:
storm-control broadcast level 10.00
: Sets the broadcast storm control level to 10.00% of the interface bandwidth.

storm-control multicast level 10.00
: Sets the multicast storm control level to 10.00% of the interface bandwidth.

storm-control action shutdown
: In case of a storm control threshold breach,
 the interface will be shut down to prevent further propagation of the storm.

QoS and Auto-QoS Configuration:
auto qos trust
: Enables Auto-QoS trust on the interface,
which allows the switch to automatically configure
Quality of Service (QoS) settings based on device type.

Port Security Configuration:
switchport priority extend trust
: Extends the trust state to attached devices,
allowing devices to inherit the trust state of the interface.

no snmp trap link-status authentication event fail action next-method
: Disables SNMP traps when authentication fails.

authentication event server dead action reinitialize vlan 101
: When the authentication server becomes unreachable,
 the interface will reinitialize and use VLAN 101 for data traffic.

authentication event server dead action authorize voice
: When the authentication server becomes unreachable,
the interface will authorize voice VLAN 201 for voice traffic.

802.1X Port-Based Authentication Configuration: 
The interface is configured for multi-authentication mode (authentication host-mode multi-auth),
allowing multiple devices to authenticate on the same port.

Authentication methods (dot1x and mab) are specified with their priorities,
and the switch attempts authentication using these methods.

The authentication periodic commands configure reauthentication settings,
with periodic restarts every 900 seconds and reauthentication requests sent to the server.

authentication violation replace
: Specifies the action to be taken when an authentication violation occurs
 (e.g., unauthorized device connected).

Overall, this configuration enables 802.1X port-based authentication on the specified GigabitEthernet interface
, applies port security and storm control settings, and configures QoS and other port-related features.
 These settings help enhance network security, ensure proper device authentication,
 and optimize traffic handling on the switch interface.
```
```python
MAC Authentication Bypass (MAB):
mab
: This command enables MAC Authentication Bypass,
 which allows devices with valid MAC addresses to bypass 802.1X authentication and gain network access.

802.1X Port-Based Authentication:
dot1x pae authenticator
: This command sets the switch to act as an authenticator in the 802.1X port-based
 authentication process, enforcing authentication on devices connected to the specified interfaces.

802.1X Timeout Configuration:
dot1x timeout tx-period 10
: This command sets the maximum period (in seconds)
that the switch waits for a response from the supplicant during 802.1X authentication.

Port Configuration:
Two GigabitEthernet interfaces (GigabitEthernet1/0/37 and GigabitEthernet1/0/38) are configured with specific settings.
For both interfaces:
description: Provides a description for the interface.
switchport: Enables Layer 2 switching on the interface.
switchport mode access: Sets the interface to access mode, where only one VLAN is allowed.
switchport access vlan 900: Specifies VLAN 900 as the data VLAN for the interface.
no cdp enable: Disables the Cisco Discovery Protocol (CDP) on the interface.

spanning-tree portfast: Enables PortFast on the interface,
which reduces the spanning-tree convergence time for access ports.

spanning-tree bpduguard enable: Enables BPDU Guard on the interface
to protect against rogue switches or misconfigurations.

storm-control broadcast level 10.00
: Sets the broadcast storm control level to 10.00% of the interface bandwidth.

storm-control multicast level 10.00
: Sets the multicast storm control level to 10.00% of the interface bandwidth.

storm-control action shutdown: In case of a storm control threshold breach
, the interface will be shut down to prevent further propagation of the storm.

auto qos trust
: Enables Auto-QoS trust on the interface,
which allows the switch to automatically configure Quality of Service (QoS) settings based on device type.

switchport priority extend trust
: Extends the trust state to attached devices, allowing devices to inherit the trust state of the interface.

no snmp trap link-status: Disables SNMP traps when the link status changes.

Control Plane Configuration:
control-plane
: This command enters the control-plane configuration mode
for making control-plane-related settings.

service-policy input system-cpp-policy
: This command applies a service policy named "system-cpp-policy" to the input traffic of the control plane.

Overall, this configuration implements MAB and 802.1X on the specified GigabitEthernet interfaces
, applies port security and storm control settings, and configures Auto-QoS on the interfaces
. Additionally, it applies a service policy to control-plane traffic.
These settings help enhance network security, ensure proper device authentication,
and optimize traffic handling on the interfaces.
