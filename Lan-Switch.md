```python
UDLD Configuration:
udld aggressive
: Globally enables UDLD in aggressive mode,
 which actively detects unidirectional links
and puts the interface into the errdisable state
 if such a link is detected.

udld message time 10
: Sets the UDLD message interval to 10 seconds,
 which is the time interval between UDLD protocol packets.

Spanning Tree Configuration:
spanning-tree mode rapid-pvst
: Configures the Spanning Tree Protocol to use Rapid
Per-VLAN Spanning Tree (Rapid-PVST) mode, providing
faster convergence for each VLAN.

spanning-tree loopguard default
: Enables Loop Guard on all ports that are not in a
PortFast or an EtherChannel operational state.
Loop Guard helps prevent potential bridging loops
caused by unidirectional links.

spanning-tree portfast bpduguard default
: Enables BPDU Guard on all PortFast-enabled ports
. BPDU Guard disables the port if it receives a BPDU, helping to prevent loops.

Port-channels Configuration:
interface Port-channel #
: Configures a Port-channel interface.
Replace "#" with the desired port-channel number.

description Connect to Switchostname - Manulife Monitor
: Provides a description for the Port-channel interface.

switchport
: Enables Layer 2 switching on the interface.

switchport mode trunk
: Sets the interface to trunk mode, allowing
 it to carry traffic for multiple VLANs.

switchport trunk allowed vlan xx
: Specifies which VLANs are allowed on the trunk
. Replace "xx" with the desired VLAN numbers.
```
```python
Trunk Ports Configuration:
interface TenGigabitEthernetx/x/X
: Configures a Ten Gigabit Ethernet interface.
 Replace "x/x/X" with the desired interface number.

description Connect to Switchostname_Portinfo - Manulife Monitor
: Provides a description for the Ten Gigabit Ethernet interface.

switchport
: Enables Layer 2 switching on the interface.

switchport mode trunk
: Sets the interface to trunk mode, allowing it to carry traffic for multiple VLANs.

switchport trunk allowed vlan xx
: Specifies which VLANs are allowed on the trunk.
 Replace "xx" with the desired VLAN numbers.

channel-group # mode active
: Adds the interface to a port-channel group.
Replace "#" with the desired port-channel number,
 matching the previously configured Port-channel interface.
```

The provided configuration appears to be related to RADIUS (Remote Authentication Dial-In User Service)
 server settings and 802.1X (dot1x) system authentication control on a network device. Let's break down the commands:

RADIUS Client Configuration:

The device is configured as a RADIUS client, and four RADIUS servers
 are defined with their IP addresses, authentication ports (1812), and accounting ports (1813).
For each RADIUS server, there is a "server-key" specified,
which is the shared secret used to encrypt communication between the RADIUS client and the RADIUS server.

Port Configuration:
port 3799
: This command sets the port number to 3799.
This port is commonly used for the RADIUS CoA (Change of Authorization) feature.

RADIUS Server Dead Time:
radius-server deadtime 1
: This command sets the RADIUS server dead time to 1 minute.
 The dead time is the period during which a RADIUS server is considered unavailable after not responding to previous requests.

RADIUS Server Load-Balance Method:
radius-server load-balance method least-outstanding
: This command sets the load-balancing method to "least-outstanding,"
which means the RADIUS client will select the RADIUS server with the least number
of outstanding requests when sending authentication or accounting requests.

RADIUS Server Configuration:
Four RADIUS servers are configured with the names
"CPPM-SGF5," "CPPM-SGVIP," "CPPM-HKF5," and "CPPM-HKVIP."
Each server has a specific IP address and a server-key for authentication.

RADIUS Source Interface:
ip radius source-interface Vlan100
: This command sets the source interface for sending RADIUS packets as "Vlan100."

802.1X System Authentication Control:
dot1x system-auth-control
: This command enables 802.1X system authentication control
, which means that the device will enforce authentication on all 802.1X-capable interfaces.

Overall, this configuration sets up the device to use RADIUS servers
for authentication and accounting purposes, with load balancing and redundancy features.
The 802.1X system authentication control ensures that all 802.1X-capable interfaces require authentication before allowing network access.
