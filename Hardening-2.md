: Configures NTP servers with IP addresses
and associates key ID 1 for authentication.

Logging Configuration:
logging buffered 16000
: Sets the buffer size for logging messages to 16000 bytes.

: Sets the inactivity timeout for VTY sessions to
10 minutes (10 minutes of inactivity will log the user out).
privilege level 15
: Sets the privilege level to 15
 (highest privilege level, equivalent to the enable mode).
transport preferred none
